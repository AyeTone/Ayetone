# 👋🏽 Troy Richards (He/Him) 🔮 Frontend Developer 💻

Hello and welcome to my Github Page! My goal is to get into the world of tech. To achieve that goal, I have begun learning Frontend Development.

Like many people, I lost my job when covid-19 hit. At the time, I believed everything would be okay because I was working on getting into day trading. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. As I failed to become successful in trading, I became desperate, looking for a way to make ends meet. After losing my job at Publix due to an injury, I turned to the internet. This is how I began my pursuit of learning Web Development.

I began to take courses at SkillCrush and felt like I found something I could be passionate about. Watching as the code I wrote caused the things on the page to move and look good made the artist in me feel amazing. Now I am looking to find a role that will help me progress to the next level.
